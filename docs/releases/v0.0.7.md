## Version 0.0.7

This release introduces major improvements to the file preview experience in the Web UI, including commit navigation for all file types, enhanced error handling, and comprehensive documentation updates. Several bugs affecting file previews and documentation formatting have also been addressed.

### New Features

- Added commit navigation for all files in the preview modal, including Previous/Next buttons, contextual labels (Latest, Oldest, Commit X of Y), and support for all file types (not just images).
