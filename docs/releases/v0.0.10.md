## Version 0.0.10

This release introduces a major improvement to the workflow for saving plots with datasets, making it easier and more flexible to commit visualizations. The deprecated save_plot() API has been removed in favor of a more streamlined approach. Additional improvements include enhanced documentation, updated tutorials, and code quality fixes.

### New Features

- Added support for committing matplotlib and plotly plot objects directly via dataset.commit(), with automatic conversion to SVG or WebP formats and intelligent filename generation. Also includes new helper functions for plot serialization and comprehensive tests. Documentation and tutorials have been updated to reflect these changes. (67bcad0) (Eric Ma)
