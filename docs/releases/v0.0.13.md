# Version v0.0.13

This release improves the catalog removal workflow in the web interface, making it more intuitive and flexible. Users can now remove catalogs from their list even if they contain datasets, with clear messaging about what happens to the underlying data.

## New Features

- Allow users to remove catalogs from their list even when the catalog contains datasets; the removal is now a local-only operation and does not affect datasets on storage. The interface provides clear messaging and an optional link to view the catalog. (4e37b0) (Eric Ma)
- Add a whitespace-nowrap utility to styles for improved UI consistency. (4e37b0) (Eric Ma)

## Bug Fixes

- Fix delete confirmation alert copy to prevent awkward line breaks by wrapping text in spans, ensuring better readability. (4e37b0) (Eric Ma)

## Deprecations

- The backend precondition for catalog deletion has been dropped; POST delete_catalog now always succeeds and only removes the config entry locally. (4e37b0) (Eric Ma)
