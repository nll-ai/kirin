## Version 0.0.6

This release introduces major new features for model and plot versioning, significant improvements to dependency management, and several bug fixes to enhance reliability and developer experience. The update also includes UI enhancements for authentication and code quality improvements throughout the codebase.

### New Features

- **Model Versioning Support**: Added support for model versioning by extending commits and datasets to include metadata and tags. New methods for querying and comparing model versions are available, along with updated documentation and a demo notebook. All references from "gitdata" to "kirin" have been updated.

- **Plot Versioning with SVG/WebP and Thumbnails**: Introduced plot saving functionality with automatic format detection (SVG for vector, WebP for raster), support for matplotlib and plotly, thumbnail generation and storage, and integration with the web UI for image previews. Comprehensive tests and documentation updates included. (29fbb4) (Eric Ma)

### Bug Fixes

- **/tmp/ File Filtering in CI**: Fixed an issue where test files in `/tmp/` were incorrectly filtered out during CI runs, causing test failures. Now, only IPython-related temporary files are skipped. (a186a6) (Eric Ma)
- **Pytest and Coverage in Pixi Environments**: Added `pytest` and `pytest-cov` to the pixi test dependencies to fix failing CI jobs due to missing packages. (e08cda) (Eric Ma)
- **Catalog Auto-Authentication**: Improved catalog authentication by adding a dedicated endpoint, proactive authentication before listing datasets, and better error detection for expired tokens. The UI now allows users to manually trigger authentication. (a388ac) (Eric Ma)
- **Erroneous Notebook Cell Removed**: Deleted an unintended code cell from a prototype notebook to clean up the codebase. (2a698c) (Eric Ma)

### Improvements & Refactoring

- **Pixi-First Dependency Management**: Reorganized dependencies to follow a pixi-first approach, unpinning versions for flexibility, removing duplication, and improving documentation for dependency management. (1bd03f) (Eric Ma)
- **Plot Source Linking Code Quality**: Refactored plot source linking logic for better organization, type hints, error handling, and removed dead code. Tests and documentation were updated accordingly. (5c1245) (Eric Ma)
- **Code Formatting**: Cleaned up code formatting by removing unnecessary blank lines and condensing function calls for improved readability. (16740b) (Eric Ma)

### Deprecations
