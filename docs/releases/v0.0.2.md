## Version 0.0.2

This release introduces major new features for cloud storage support, a FastAPI-based web UI, improved authentication, and significant enhancements to dataset management and usability. The project now supports content-addressed storage with visible filenames, lazy file loading, and a more robust, cloud-agnostic architecture. Numerous improvements to documentation, testing, and CI/CD workflows are also included.

### New Features

- Add FastAPI-based web UI for dataset, file, and commit management, with shadcn/ui-inspired design and HTMX partials. Includes CRUD operations, commit history visualization, and file preview. (ee5e7f, Eric Ma)
- Add cloud authentication helpers for S3, GCS, Azure, and S3-compatible services, enabling seamless local and cloud storage via fsspec. (ee5e7f, Eric Ma)
- Refactor Dataset and DatasetCommit to support fsspec filesystems, allowing all file operations to work with local and cloud storage. (ee5e7f, Eric Ma)
- Implement content-addressed storage with visible filenames, supporting deduplication and automatic migration from old formats. (89c920, Eric Ma)
- Add cloud-agnostic authentication parameters to Catalog, Dataset, and web UI, supporting S3, GCS, and Azure authentication. (9a2afb, Eric Ma)
- Add AWS profile selection and lazy directory creation for S3 compatibility, with improved error handling and unified catalog forms in the web UI. (b948ec, Eric Ma)
- Add secure cloud auth detection, keyring credential storage, and improved backend authentication UX, including CLI and web UI enhancements. (4dd1d2, Eric Ma)
- Implement lazy loading for local_files context manager in Dataset, introducing LazyLocalFiles for efficient file access and caching. (365b7d, Eric Ma)
- Add initial implementation of Data Catalog for managing collections of datasets, with methods for listing, retrieving, and creating datasets. (c1fc76, Eric Ma)
- Add dataset length functionality to Catalog and shared testing utilities for improved test coverage. (2bdbe3, Eric Ma)
- Add local file access context manager, partial hash resolution for Dataset.checkout, and improved file utilities for easier file operations. (637ac7, Eric Ma)
- Add search functionality to filter datasets by name or description in the web UI. (9acdeb, Eric Ma)
- Add tabbed interface for datasets and dataset creation, with improved responsive grid and utility classes in the web UI. (7c2750, Eric Ma)
- Add Python code snippets to web UI, including cloud authentication parameters and copy-to-clipboard functionality. (16857a, Eric Ma)
- Add rebase merge strategy for linear commit history, with updated visualization and Marimo notebook demo. (852f14, Eric Ma)
- Add interactive commit tree view with Mermaid.js and view toggle to dataset UI. (d1d845, Eric Ma)
- Add comprehensive regression tests for Git semantics and rebase merge workflow. (c5bce5, Eric Ma)
- Add debugging and testing scripts for commit structure and git semantics. (81e710, Eric Ma)
- Add detailed documentation for design, architecture, and best practices, including AGENTS.md, guides, and expanded README. (9ba556, Eric Ma; 8f2a62, Eric Ma)
- Add mkdocstrings and related dependencies for improved documentation generation. (4d5e32, Eric Ma)

### Bug Fixes

- Fix file download endpoint in web UI and update integration tests to match new API routes. (c2083c, Eric Ma)
- Show correct commit counts for datasets on catalog landing page, with tests and documentation. (95082f, Eric Ma)
- Fix markdownlint compliance across all documentation files. (07b606, Eric Ma)

### Deprecations

- BREAKING CHANGE: Dataset and DatasetCommit now require fsspec filesystem compatibility; all file operations are routed through fsspec. Users must install appropriate cloud dependencies (s3fs, gcsfs, adlfs, etc.) for cloud storage support. (ee5e7f, Eric Ma)
- BREAKING CHANGE: The prototype notebook is replaced by new local and GCP demo notebooks. The new web UI is now the primary interface for dataset management. Old dataset creation patterns may need to be updated. (e80d04, Eric Ma)
- BREAKING CHANGE: Branching, merging, and web UI are no longer supported. All history is now linear-only. (5cdf91, Eric Ma)
- BREAKING CHANGE: All previous 'backend' routes, forms, and configuration are now replaced by 'catalog' equivalents in the web UI and API. (60c5cc, Eric Ma)
