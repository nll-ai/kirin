## Version 0.0.11

This release introduces major improvements to the widget system, including file previews, enhanced code snippet handling, and significant codebase refactoring for maintainability. Several bugs related to user interaction with widgets have also been fixed, and code formatting in tutorials has been improved for readability.

### New Features

- Added file previews to widget HTML, supporting CSV (as tables), JSON, and text files, with interactive click handlers and comprehensive styling. Widget HTML generation now uses Jinja2 templates for maintainability. (344d2f, Eric Ma)
- Added support for variable names and a data-code attribute in widgets, allowing code snippets to use the correct variable name and improving test compatibility. Commit widgets now include the full hash in code snippets. (988a91, Eric Ma)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed copy button behavior by using event delegation, preventing file previews from opening when clicking the copy button and ensuring robust handling with dynamic content. (044b67, Eric Ma)

### Refactoring

- Extracted duplicated JavaScript and HTML code into shared modules and macros, introduced a BaseWidget class, and updated all templates and widgets to use these shared components, eliminating over 300 lines of duplication. (d9f23b, Eric Ma)

### Style Improvements

- Reformatted code in the first-dataset.py tutorial for better readability and improved documentation presentation. (28bccd, Eric Ma)

### Deprecations

- None in this release.
