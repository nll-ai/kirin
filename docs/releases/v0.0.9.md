## Version 0.0.9

This release introduces major improvements to the web UI, enhanced support for machine learning artifact tracking, and several robustness and usability fixes. Users will benefit from richer commit metadata visualization, improved image preview controls, and more reliable model variable name detection, especially in CI environments.

### New Features

- Display commit tags and metadata in dataset and file views, including badges for tags and a collapsible JSON metadata viewer with syntax highlighting. Added image preview mode toggle (fit/scroll) with persistent user preference, and improved UI consistency for tags and metadata sections. (9f3e46, Eric Ma)
- Enhance the commit() API to automatically handle scikit-learn models: auto-serialize models, extract hyperparameters and metrics, detect variable names for filenames, link source scripts, and store model-specific metadata. Added sklearn version tracking, comprehensive tests, and updated documentation. (98ce83, Eric Ma)
- Add ty type checker to pre-commit hooks for improved code quality. (1e65ba, Eric Ma)

### Bug Fixes

- Fix detection of internal files in CI environments with duplicate /kirin/ segments, ensuring user code is correctly identified. Also, simplify and clean up model variable name detection logic. (3b5f64, Eric Ma)
- Improve robustness of model variable name detection in CI environments by handling frame inspection errors and avoiding source line loading. (a23f10, Eric Ma)
- Remove fallback to class names for variable name detection, raising clear errors when detection fails to ensure metadata consistency. (446706, Eric Ma)
- Fix end-of-file formatting to ensure exactly one newline. (5bb41d, Eric Ma)
- Fix linting issues related to line length and make the ty pre-commit hook optional. (a60d1e, Eric Ma)

### Deprecations

- Remove manual model saving and metadata creation steps from ml-workflow.py, as Kirin now auto-extracts and serializes models and metadata. Clean up redundant and unused code, and ensure commit() only passes essential metrics and tags. (08250a, Eric Ma)
- Remove fallback to class names for variable name detection in dataset and ML artifact code, requiring explicit variable names for metadata keys. (446706, Eric Ma)
