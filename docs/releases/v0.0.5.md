## Version 0.0.5

This release introduces automatic authentication and timeout protection for cloud catalog access in the web UI, along with improved documentation and testing for these new features. Users can now configure authentication commands for cloud providers, and the UI will automatically attempt to authenticate and retry operations if needed, providing a smoother and more secure experience.

### New Features

- Added automatic authentication and timeout protection for cloud catalog access. If a catalog operation fails due to authentication or timeout, the system will attempt to authenticate using a configurable CLI command and retry the operation. This includes improved error handling and user feedback in the web UI, as well as timeout protection for dataset operations to prevent UI hangs. (68fd97) (Eric Ma)
- Documented the new web UI auto-authentication and timeout features, including configuration instructions for AWS, GCP, and Azure, security considerations, and troubleshooting guidance. Also added fast unit tests for authentication timeout and auto-execution behaviors. (bc4a92) (Eric Ma)
