# Ecosystem Due Diligence

This document tracks our evaluation of third-party libraries and tools for GitData's content-addressed storage and version control needs.

## Content-Addressed Storage Libraries

### [`hashfs`](https://github.com/dgilland/hashfs) - ❌ Not Recommended

**Status**: Evaluated in detail - see [HashFS Evaluation](./hashfs-evaluation.md)

**Key Findings**:
- **Maintenance**: Last commit 5 years ago (July 2019), appears unmaintained
- **Architecture**: Local filesystem only, no cloud backend support
- **Integration**: No fsspec support, would require complete architectural rewrite
- **Features**: Missing version control, metadata tracking, usage analytics
- **Performance**: Memory-intensive, no streaming support for large files

**Decision**: **Do not integrate** - GitData's current architecture is more sophisticated and feature-complete.

**Rationale**:
- HashFS lacks critical features (versioning, cloud support, metadata)
- Would require complete rewrite of storage layer
- Loss of multi-backend support (S3, GCS, Azure, etc.)
- Current GitData implementation already provides content addressing
- Better to enhance current system with HashFS-inspired optimizations

### [`s3-cas`](https://github.com/nuchi/s3-cas) - ❌ Not Suitable

**Status**: Brief evaluation

**Key Findings**:
- **Maintenance**: Appears unmaintained
- **Scope**: S3-specific, not flexible for multi-backend architecture
- **Features**: Basic content addressing, no version control or metadata
- **Use Case**: Good for learning S3 CAS patterns, not production use

**Decision**: **Not suitable** - Too narrow in scope, doesn't align with GitData's multi-backend requirements.

## Current Implementation Strategy

**Approach**: Custom content-addressed storage built on fsspec

**Rationale**:
- **Multi-backend support**: Native fsspec integration for S3, GCS, Azure, local, etc.
- **Version control**: Full Git-like versioning with commits, branches, merging
- **Metadata tracking**: Commit messages, authors, timestamps, usage analytics
- **Performance**: Streaming operations, memory-efficient large file handling
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new backends and features

**Current Architecture**:
```
<root>/
├── data/                    # Content-addressed file storage
│   ├── {hash}/             # SHA256 hash directory
│   │   └── filename        # Original filename preserved
│   └── ...
├── datasets/               # Dataset metadata and versioning
│   └── {dataset_name}/
│       ├── refs/heads/     # Branch references
│       ├── HEAD            # Current branch pointer
│       └── {commit_hash}/   # Individual commits
│           └── commit.json # Commit metadata
└── usage.db               # Planned SQLite usage tracking
```

**Enhancement Opportunities**:
- **Deduplication**: Add automatic file deduplication
- **Directory optimization**: Consider nested directory structure for large file counts
- **Repair capabilities**: Add storage repair and validation
- **Performance**: Optimize for large-scale deployments

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Git LFS (Large File Storage)
- **Pros**: Git-native, well-supported, handles large files
- **Cons**: Server-dependent, complex setup, not content-addressed
- **Decision**: Not suitable for serverless, content-addressed architecture

### IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)
- **Pros**: Distributed, content-addressed, peer-to-peer
- **Cons**: Complex setup, performance overhead, not Git-like
- **Decision**: Overkill for GitData's use case, adds unnecessary complexity

### Custom Git Objects
- **Pros**: Git-native, proven scalability, familiar to developers
- **Cons**: Complex implementation, not optimized for data workflows
- **Decision**: Current fsspec-based approach is more suitable for data science use cases

## Lessons Learned

1. **Architecture matters more than features**: GitData's multi-backend, version-controlled architecture is more valuable than simple content addressing
2. **fsspec is the right abstraction**: Provides the flexibility needed for multi-backend support
3. **Version control is essential**: Content addressing alone isn't sufficient for data versioning
4. **Metadata tracking is critical**: Usage analytics and lineage tracking are key differentiators
5. **Performance optimization**: Streaming and memory efficiency are crucial for large datasets

## Future Considerations

- **Monitor ecosystem**: Watch for new CAS libraries with fsspec support
- **Performance optimization**: Consider implementing HashFS-inspired directory nesting
- **Deduplication**: Add automatic file deduplication to current system
- **Repair capabilities**: Implement storage integrity checking and repair
- **Cloud optimization**: Optimize for specific cloud backends (S3, GCS, etc.)
