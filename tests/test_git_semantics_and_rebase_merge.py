"""
Test Git semantics and rebase merge behavior in Kirin.

This comprehensive test demonstrates the complete workflow of:
1. Creating a dataset with proper Git semantics
2. Branching and merging with rebase strategy
3. Verifying correct commit history and no duplicates
4. Testing branch switching behavior

This test was created to verify the fix for the "two initial commits" issue
and ensure proper Git semantics are maintained throughout the workflow.

Key features tested:
- Proper Git semantics (commits don't belong to branches)
- Rebase merge creates linear history without duplicates
- Branch switching works correctly
- Commit history is consistent between different methods
- No duplicate commits or messages in branch history

This test serves as a regression test to ensure that the Git semantics
fix and rebase merge improvements continue to work correctly.

GOLDEN TEST: This test has been verified to have the correct behavior and should not be modified.
