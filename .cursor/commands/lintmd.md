# Markdown Linting Command

Run markdownlint on all Markdown files in the directory that I tell you to do it
on, otherwise, just do it on all markdown files. Fix all issues identified by
markdownlint. At the end, re-run markdownlint to ensure there are no issues
left.

Some exceptions: mermaid diagrams can be left as-is, especially if they are
complex.
