# Shorten Test Times

I want you to make the test times shorter. What can we do? Use pytest with
durations to show test times. Study the ones that are taking a very long
time and categorize the issues that you think are making them slow. The goal
is to find any common root causes and fix them. (There may not necessarily
be any, but we should look for them.) Then make a plan to fix the issues.
