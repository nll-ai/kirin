# File Removal UI Design Choices

## Visual Hierarchy & Layout

### Card-Based Design

We chose a card-based design for file removal items to create clear visual
separation and hierarchy. Each file item is presented as an individual card
with:

- **Background**: Clean white/card background using `hsl(var(--card))`
- **Subtle shadows**: `box-shadow: 0 1px 2px hsl(var(--border) / 0.1)` for
  depth
- **Rounded corners**: 8px border radius for modern, friendly appearance
- **Generous padding**: 1rem vertical, 1.25rem horizontal for breathing room

This approach makes each file feel like a distinct, interactive element rather
than just text in a list.

### Horizontal Layout

We implemented a strict horizontal layout with:

- **Flexbox alignment**: `display: flex`, `flex-direction: row`,
  `align-items: center`
- **Consistent spacing**: 1rem gap between checkbox, icon, and text
- **Proper element sizing**: Checkbox and icon are `flex-shrink: 0` to maintain
  size

This creates a clean, scannable interface where users can quickly identify and
select files.

## Interactive Design

### Checkbox Design

We chose a larger, more prominent checkbox design:

- **Size**: 24px Ã— 24px (larger than standard 16px) for better visibility
- **Color**: Red accent color (`hsl(var(--destructive))`) to signal destructive
  action
- **Focus states**: Red outline for accessibility compliance
- **Smooth transitions**: 0.2s ease for all state changes

The larger size and red color immediately communicate that this is a removal
action, reducing user confusion.

### Hover & Selection States

We implemented sophisticated interaction feedback:

- **Hover effects**: Subtle lift animation (`translateY(-1px)`) with enhanced
  shadows
- **Checked state**: Red-tinted background with red border and icon
- **Smooth transitions**: All interactions animate smoothly for polished feel

These states provide clear visual feedback about user actions and system state.

## Color & Typography

### Color System

We leveraged the existing design system colors:

- **Destructive actions**: Red color scheme for removal operations
- **Muted elements**: File icons use muted colors that brighten on interaction
- **Consistent theming**: All colors use CSS custom properties for consistency

### Typography Hierarchy

We refined the text presentation:

- **Filename**: 0.95rem, medium weight, proper line height for readability
- **File size**: 0.8rem, muted color, with proper spacing from filename
- **Color contrast**: Ensured proper contrast ratios for accessibility

## Animation & Transitions

### Smooth Interactions

We implemented consistent 0.2s ease transitions for:

- **Hover states**: Background, border, and shadow changes
- **Selection states**: Color and opacity changes
- **Focus states**: Outline and accent color changes

This creates a polished, professional feel that responds immediately to user
input.

### Micro-interactions

We added subtle animations:

- **Lift effect**: Items slightly rise on hover for depth perception
- **Color transitions**: Icons and backgrounds smoothly change color
- **Shadow evolution**: Shadows grow and change color based on state

These micro-interactions provide delightful feedback without being distracting.

## Accessibility Considerations

### Focus Management

We ensured proper keyboard navigation:

- **Focus outlines**: Red outline on checkbox focus for visibility
- **Proper tab order**: Logical navigation through interactive elements
- **Color contrast**: Sufficient contrast ratios for all text elements

### Visual Clarity

We prioritized clear visual communication:

- **Larger touch targets**: 24px checkbox for easier interaction
- **Clear state indication**: Obvious visual difference between
  checked/unchecked
- **Consistent spacing**: Predictable layout for screen readers

## Design System Integration

### CSS Custom Properties

We used the existing design system variables:

- **Color tokens**: `--destructive`, `--card`, `--border`, `--foreground`
- **Consistent theming**: All colors adapt to light/dark themes
- **Maintainable code**: Easy to update colors across the entire system

### Component Classes

We created reusable component classes:

- **`.file-remove-item`**: Main container styling
- **`.file-remove-checkbox`**: Checkbox-specific styling
- **Modular approach**: Easy to apply to other similar interfaces

This approach ensures consistency and maintainability across the application.
